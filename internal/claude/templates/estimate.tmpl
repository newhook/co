You are working on Estimation Task {{.TaskID}}.

Instructions:
1. First, check the task details with: co task show {{.TaskID}}
   - This will show which beads need estimation and their current status
2. For each bead that is NOT already completed:
   - Use 'bd show <bead-id>' to examine the bead's details
   - Estimate its complexity and token usage
   - Run: co estimate <bead-id> --score <complexity> --tokens <estimated-tokens> --task {{.TaskID}}

Complexity Scoring Guide:
- 1 = Trivial change (typo fix, one-liner, config change)
- 2-3 = Simple change (small function, straightforward bug fix)
- 4-5 = Medium change (new feature, multiple file changes)
- 6-7 = Complex change (significant feature, architectural changes)
- 8-9 = Very complex (major refactor, cross-cutting concerns)
- 10 = Massive change (complete rewrite, major architectural overhaul)

Token Estimation Guide:
- 5000-10000 = Very simple changes
- 10000-20000 = Simple to medium changes
- 20000-35000 = Medium to complex changes
- 35000-50000 = Complex changes requiring deep analysis

Base your estimates on:
- Number of files likely to be modified
- Complexity of the logic involved
- Amount of context needed to understand the task
- Testing requirements
- Potential for unexpected complications

The task will auto-complete when all beads are estimated. Do not use /exit.
