You are planning for issue {{.BeadID}}.

First, use the beads skill to investigate this issue:
/beads show {{.BeadID}}

After reviewing the issue details, help plan the implementation by:
- Breaking down the work into subtasks if needed
- Identifying dependencies or blockers
- Suggesting implementation approaches
- Creating related issues with /beads create if needed

When breaking down into subtasks, create them as children of this issue:

  bd create "<subtask title>" --parent {{.BeadID}} --type task \
    --description "<description of the subtask>"

This establishes {{.BeadID}} as the parent, making the new issues its children.
The orchestrator will then process these subtasks as part of this work.

Use /beads commands throughout to manage the issue tracker.
