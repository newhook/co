You are working on Task {{.TaskID}} which includes the following beads:

{{range .BeadIDs}}- {{.}}
{{end}}

Branch: {{.BranchName}}
Base Branch: {{.BaseBranch}}

Instructions:
1. First, check git log and git status to see if there is existing work on this branch from a previous session
2. If there is existing work, review it and continue from where it left off
3. Use 'bd show <id>' to examine each bead's details
4. Implement ALL issues in this task
5. Make logical commits grouping related changes
6. For EACH issue as you complete it:
   - Close the bead: bd close <id> --reason "<brief summary>"
   - Mark complete: co complete <id>
7. When ALL issues are complete:
   - Push the branch and create a PR targeting {{.BaseBranch}}
   - Merge the PR using: gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
   - Mark the final bead complete with PR: co complete <last-id> --pr <PR_URL>

Note: co complete auto-detects your task. When all beads in the task are marked complete, the task itself is marked complete.

Focus on implementing all tasks correctly and completely.
