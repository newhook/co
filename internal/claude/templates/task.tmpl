You are working on Task {{.TaskID}}.

Branch: {{.BranchName}}
Base Branch: {{.BaseBranch}}

Instructions:
1. First, check the task status: co task show {{.TaskID}}
   - This will show which beads are in the task and their completion status
2. Check git status to see if there are uncommitted changes:
   - If changes exist, review them with git diff
   - If they appear to be partial implementation of one of your beads:
     * Complete that bead's implementation if needed
     * Close the bead: bd close <bead-id> --reason "<summary>"
     * Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "Complete <bead-id>: <description>"
   - If changes are unrelated to your beads:
     * Stash them: git stash push -m "Stashed before task {{.TaskID}}"
3. For each bead that is NOT already completed:
   - Use 'bd show <bead-id>' to examine the bead's details
   - Implement the required changes
   - Close the bead: bd close <bead-id> --reason "<brief summary>"
   - Commit the work: git add -A && git commit -m "Implement <bead-id>: <brief description>"
4. When ALL beads are complete:
   - Push the branch: git push
   - Mark the task complete: co complete {{.TaskID}}

Note: co complete auto-detects your task. When all beads in the task are marked complete, the task itself is marked complete.

DO NOT create a PR or merge - that will be handled separately after all tasks in the work are complete.

Begin by checking the task status to see what needs to be done. If retrying a failed task, only complete the beads that are not already marked as completed.
