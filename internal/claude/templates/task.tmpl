You are working on Task {{.TaskID}}.

Branch: {{.BranchName}}
Base Branch: {{.BaseBranch}}

Instructions:
1. First, check the task status: co task show {{.TaskID}}
   - This will show which beads are in the task and their completion status
2. Check git log and git status to see if there is existing work on this branch
3. For each bead that is NOT already completed:
   - Use 'bd show <bead-id>' to examine the bead's details
   - Implement the required changes
   - Close the bead: bd close <bead-id> --reason "<brief summary>"
   - Commit the work: git add -A && git commit -m "Implement <bead-id>: <brief description>"
4. When ALL beads are complete:
   - Push the branch: git push
   - Mark the task complete: co complete {{.TaskID}}

Note: co complete auto-detects your task. When all beads in the task are marked complete, the task itself is marked complete.

DO NOT create a PR or merge - that will be handled separately after all tasks in the work are complete.

Begin by checking the task status to see what needs to be done. If retrying a failed task, only complete the beads that are not already marked as completed.
