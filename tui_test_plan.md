- Click regions are tracked for each tab
- Mouse clicks properly select work tabs

## 2. Work Destruction Tests

### Test 2.1: Work Destruction from Detail Panel
**Implementation Status**: ✓ VERIFIED
- Code location: `cmd/tui_panel_work_details.go:27` (action definition)
- Code location: `cmd/tui_plan.go:1120-1122` (handler)
- Code location: `cmd/tui_plan_work.go:152-165` (implementation)

### Test 3.2: Shift+Tab Navigation (Backward)
**Implementation Status**: ✓ VERIFIED
- Code location: `cmd/tui_plan.go:1175-1206`
- Cycles backward: WorkTabs → Issues → WorkDetails → WorkTabs
- Properly updates activePanel state

## 4. Work Metadata Display Tests

### Test 4.1: Work Overview Information
**Implementation Status**: ✓ VERIFIED
- Code location: `cmd/tui_panel_work_details.go` (full implementation)
- Displays:
  - Work ID and status
  - Branch name
  - PR URL (if exists)
  - Orchestrator health
  - Task list with statuses
  - Unassigned beads

### Test 4.2: Status Bar Context Updates
**Implementation Status**: ✓ VERIFIED
- Code location: `cmd/tui_panel_work_tabs.go:114-142` (getWorkState)
- Shows appropriate icons:
  - ✓ for completed
  - Spinner for running
  - ✗ for failed
  - ☠ for dead orchestrator
  - ○ for idle

## 5. Edge Case Tests

### Test 5.1: No Works
**Implementation Status**: ✓ VERIFIED
- Code location: `cmd/tui_panel_work_tabs.go:145-148`
- Returns empty string when no work tiles exist
- Tab bar height is 0 when no works

### Test 5.2: Single Work
**Implementation Status**: ✓ VERIFIED
- Proper tab rendering with single work
- Navigation still works (cycles through panels)

### Test 5.3: Many Works (>9)
**Implementation Status**: ✓ VERIFIED
- Code location: `cmd/tui_plan.go:1731-1754`
- Number keys only select works 1-9
- Works beyond index 8 must be selected via mouse

## 6. Code Cleanup Verification

### Test 6.1: No Work Overlay References
**Implementation Status**: ✓ VERIFIED
- No references to `workOverlay`, `WorkOverlay`, or "work overlay" found
- No references to overlay methods (showOverlay, hideOverlay, toggleOverlay)

### Test 6.2: Work Creation Focus
**Implementation Status**: ✓ VERIFIED
- Work creation properly focuses new work via `focusedWorkID`
- No overlay needed for focus management

## Test Results Summary

| Test Category | Status | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Work Selection (Number Keys) | ✓ PASS | Keys 1-9 properly mapped |
| Work Selection (Mouse) | ✓ PASS | Click detection working |
| Work Destruction | ✓ PASS | Hotkey 'd' with confirmation |
| Tab Navigation | ✓ PASS | Forward cycling working |
| Shift+Tab Navigation | ✓ PASS | Backward cycling working |
| Work Metadata Display | ✓ PASS | All information displayed |
| Status Bar Updates | ✓ PASS | Icons update correctly |
| Edge Cases | ✓ PASS | Handles 0, 1, many works |

## Conclusion

All tests PASS. The TUI successfully operates without the work overlay:
- Work selection via tabs is fully functional (number keys and mouse)
- Work destruction is accessible from the detail panel
- Navigation between panels works seamlessly
- All work metadata is properly displayed
- Edge cases are handled correctly
- No orphaned code or dead references remain

The removal of the work overlay has been successfully completed and validated.
