Create `\u003cdir\u003e/` and `\u003cdir\u003e/.co/`\n2. Detect if `\u003crepo\u003e` is local path or GitHub URL\n3. If local: `ln -s \u003crepo\u003e \u003cdir\u003e/main`\n4. If GitHub: `git clone \u003crepo\u003e \u003cdir\u003e/main`\n5.

Initialize `\u003cdir\u003e/.co/tracking.db`\n\n### `co proj destroy [--force]`\n\nTears down the current project.\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Find project root (walk up looking for `.co/`)\n2. List all worktrees and prompt for confirmation (unless `--force`)\n3. Remove all worktrees via `git worktree remove`\n4. Delete project directory\n\n### `co proj status`\n\nShows project status including active worktrees and task states.\n\n## Project Context Detection\n\n`co` commands find the project by walking up from cwd looking for `.co/`:\n- `/Users/matthew/proj/bead-xyz/foo/bar` → finds `/Users/matthew/proj/.co/`\n- Override with `--project=\u003cpath\u003e` flag on any command\n\n## Modified Workflow\n\n### `co run` Changes\n\n1. **Find project context** (cwd walk or `--project` flag)\n2. **Load config** from `.co/config.toml`\n3. **Query beads** from `main/` directory (where `.beads/` lives)\n4. **For each task:**\n   - Create worktree: `git -C main/ worktree add ../\u003ctask-id\u003e -b bead/\u003ctask-id\u003e`\n   - Launch Claude in Zellij session `co-\u003cproject-name\u003e`, pane named `\u003ctask-id\u003e`\n   - Claude works in `\u003cproject-dir\u003e/\u003ctask-id\u003e/`\n   - On success: `git worktree remove \u003ctask-id\u003e`\n   - On failure: Keep worktree for debugging\n\n### Zellij Session \u0026 Pane Model\n\n**Session**: One per project, named `co-\u003cproject-name\u003e`\n**Panes**: One per task, named after the task ID\n\nExample:\n- Session: `co-myapp`\n- Panes: `bead-123`, `bead-456`, etc.\n\nThis enables:\n- Multiple projects running simultaneously (separate sessions)\n- Future parallel task execution within a project (multiple panes)\n- Easy identification: `zellij -s co-myapp` shows all tasks for that project\n\n### Worktree Cleanup\n\n- **On success**: Remove worktree immediately\n- **On failure**: Keep worktree for debugging (user can inspect/fix)\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1. Add new `internal/project/` package\n\n```go\n// internal/project/project.go\ntype Project struct {\n    Root   string      // Project directory path\n    Config *Config     // Parsed config.toml\n    DB     *db.DB      // Tracking database\n}\n\ntype Config struct {\n    Project ProjectConfig\n    Repo    RepoConfig\n}\n\ntype ProjectConfig struct {\n    Name      string\n    CreatedAt time.Time\n}\n\ntype RepoConfig struct {\n    Type   string  // \"local\" or \"github\"\n    Source string  // Original path or URL\n    Path   string  // Always \"main\"\n}\n\nfunc Find(startDir string) (*Project, error)      // Walk up to find .co/\nfunc Create(dir, repoSource string) (*Project, error)\nfunc (p *Project) MainRepoPath() string           // Returns \u003croot\u003e/main\nfunc (p *Project) WorktreePath(taskID string) string\n```\n\n### 2. Add new `internal/worktree/` package\n\n```go\n// internal/worktree/worktree.go\nfunc Create(repoPath, worktreePath, branch string) error\nfunc Remove(repoPath, worktreePath string) error\nfunc List(repoPath string) ([]Worktree, error)\nfunc Exists(repoPath, worktreePath string) bool\n```\n\n### 3. Add `cmd/proj.go` with subcommands\n\n- `co proj create \u003cdir\u003e \u003crepo\u003e`\n- `co proj destroy [--force]`\n- `co proj status`\n\n### 4. Update `cmd/run.go`\n\n- Add `--project` flag\n- Use `project.Find()` to get context\n- Query beads from `project.MainRepoPath()`\n- Create worktrees for each task\n- Clean up worktrees on completion\n\n### 5. Update `internal/claude/runner.go`\n\n- Accept project name parameter\n- Use session name `co-\u003cproject\u003e` (one session per project)\n- Pane name is the task ID\n- Work directory is the worktree path\n\n### 6.
