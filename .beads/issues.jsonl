Add `task_type` column to tasks table (\"implement\" vs \"estimate\")\n2. Create an estimate task with all beads needing complexity estimation\n3. Run the task using existing `Run()` mechanism (different prompt)\n4. Claude runs `co estimate \u003cid\u003e --score X --tokens Y` for each bead\n5. Completion detected by checking complexity_cache has all beads\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\n1. **Reuse task infrastructure** - Estimate tasks use same DB tables, same `Run()` function\n2. **Task type column** - Distinguishes implement vs estimate tasks\n3. **`co estimate` command** - Claude reports estimates, auto-completes task when all done\n4. **Single estimate task** - All uncached beads estimated in one Claude session\n\n## Verification\n\n1. Build: `go build -o co .`\n2. Test: `go test ./...`\n3. Create a project with some beads\n4. Run `co plan --auto-group`\n5.

Database Schema Updates\n\n#### Create migration: `internal/db/migrations/002_add_works.sql`\n```sql\n-- UP\nCREATE TABLE works (\n    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',\n    zellij_session TEXT,\n    zellij_tab TEXT,\n    worktree_path TEXT,\n    branch_name TEXT,\n    pr_url TEXT,\n    error_message TEXT,\n    started_at DATETIME,\n    completed_at DATETIME,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_works_status ON works(status);\n\n-- Add work_id to tasks table\nALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN work_id TEXT REFERENCES works(id);\nCREATE INDEX idx_tasks_work_id ON tasks(work_id);\n\n-- Remove worktree_path from tasks (now managed by work)\nALTER TABLE tasks DROP COLUMN worktree_path;\n\n-- Junction table for work-task relationship (for flexibility)\nCREATE TABLE work_tasks (\n    work_id TEXT NOT NULL,\n    task_id TEXT NOT NULL,\n    position INTEGER DEFAULT 0,\n    PRIMARY KEY (work_id, task_id),\n    FOREIGN KEY (work_id) REFERENCES works(id),\n    FOREIGN KEY (task_id) REFERENCES tasks(id)\n);\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_work_tasks_work_id ON work_tasks(work_id);\nCREATE INDEX idx_work_tasks_task_id ON work_tasks(task_id);\n\n-- DOWN\nDROP TABLE work_tasks;\nDROP INDEX idx_tasks_work_id;\nALTER TABLE tasks DROP COLUMN work_id;\nALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN worktree_path TEXT;\nDROP INDEX idx_works_status;\nDROP TABLE works;\n```\n\n#### Update reference schema: `internal/db/schema.sql`\n- Add works table definition\n- Update tasks table (add work_id, remove worktree_path)\n- Add work_tasks junction table\n\n### 2. SQLC Query Updates\n\n#### Create: `sql/queries/works.sql`\n```sql\n-- name: CreateWork :exec\nINSERT INTO works (id, status, worktree_path, branch_name)\nVALUES (?, ?, ?, ?);\n\n-- name: StartWork :exec\nUPDATE works SET\n    status = 'processing',\n    zellij_session = ?,\n    zellij_tab = ?,\n    started_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\nWHERE id = ?;\n\n-- name: CompleteWork :exec\nUPDATE works SET\n    status = 'completed',\n    pr_url = ?,\n    completed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\nWHERE id = ?;\n\n-- name: FailWork :exec\nUPDATE works SET\n    status = 'failed',\n    error_message = ?,\n    completed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\nWHERE id = ?;\n\n-- name: GetWork :one\nSELECT * FROM works WHERE id = ?;\n\n-- name: ListWorks :many\nSELECT * FROM works ORDER BY created_at;\n\n-- name: GetLastWorkID :one\nSELECT id FROM works\nORDER BY created_at DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\n-- name: AddTaskToWork :exec\nINSERT INTO work_tasks (work_id, task_id, position)\nVALUES (?, ?, ?);\n\n-- name: GetWorkTasks :many\nSELECT t.* FROM tasks t\nJOIN work_tasks wt ON t.id = wt.task_id\nWHERE wt.work_id = ?\nORDER BY wt.position;\n\n-- name: GetWorkByDirectory :one\nSELECT * FROM works\nWHERE worktree_path LIKE ?;\n```\n\n#### Update: `sql/queries/tasks.sql`\n- Add work_id parameter to CreateTask\n- Remove worktree_path from StartTask\n- Add queries for work-related operations\n\n### 3. Go Model Updates\n\n#### Create: `internal/db/work.go`\n```go\npackage db\n\ntype Work struct {\n    ID            string\n    Status        string\n    ZellijSession string\n    ZellijTab     string\n    WorktreePath  string\n    BranchName    string\n    PRURL         string\n    ErrorMessage  string\n    StartedAt     *time.Time\n    CompletedAt   *time.Time\n    CreatedAt     time.Time\n}\n\n// Methods: CreateWork, StartWork, CompleteWork, FailWork, GetWork, ListWorks\n// AddTaskToWork, GetWorkTasks, IsWorkCompleted\n```\n\n#### Update: `internal/db/task.go`\n- Add WorkID field to Task struct\n- Update CreateTask to accept work_id\n- Remove worktree management from StartTask\n\n### 4. Planning Phase Updates\n\n#### Update: `cmd/plan.go`\n\nNew planning workflow with context-aware work detection:\n1. Determine work context (from flag or current directory)\n2. Fetch ready beads from beads system\n3. Group beads into tasks (existing logic)\n4. Create tasks with work_id reference\n5. Create task_beads relationships\n\nPlanning modes:\n- `co plan` - Plan tasks for current work (when in work dir)\n- `co plan --work \u003cid\u003e` - Plan tasks for specified work\n- `co plan --auto-group` - Auto-group beads into tasks\n- `co plan bead1,bead2 bead3` - Manual grouping\n\nExample workflows:\n```bash\n# Method 1: Work from within work directory\nco work create             # Creates work-1\ncd work-1\nco plan --auto-group       # Plans for work-1\nco run                     # Runs work-1\n\n# Method 2: Specify work explicitly\nco work create             # Creates work-2\nco plan --work work-2 bead-abc,bead-def\nco run --work work-2\n\n# Method 3: Work from worktree\nco work create             # Creates work-3\ncd work-3/tree\nco plan                    # Detects work context\ngit status                 # In work/work-3 branch\n```\n\n#### Create: `internal/task/work_planner.go`\n- WorkPlanner interface similar to TaskPlanner\n- Groups tasks into works based on:\n  - Complexity budgets\n  - Dependencies between tasks\n  - Logical groupings\n\n### 5. Execution Phase Updates\n\n#### Major update: `cmd/run.go`\n\nChange execution from task-centric to work-centric with context awareness:\n\n```go\nfunc runRun(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {\n    workID := cmd.Flag(\"work\").Value.String()\n    if workID == \"\" {\n        workID, _ = getCurrentWork()\n    }\n\n    if workID != \"\" {\n        // Run specific work\n        work := database.GetWork(workID)\n        processWork(work)\n    } else {\n        // Run all pending works\n        works := database.ListWorks(StatusPending)\n        sortedWorks := sortWorksByDependency(works)\n        for _, work := range sortedWorks {\n            processWork(work)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunc processWork(work Work) {\n    // 1. Worktree already exists (created during co work create)\n    worktreePath := work.WorktreePath\n\n    // 2. Create zellij tab for work\n    zellijTab := createZellijTab(work.ID)\n\n    // 3. Start work in database\n    database.StartWork(work.ID, zellijSession, zellijTab)\n\n    // 4. Get tasks for this work\n    tasks := database.GetWorkTasks(work.ID)\n\n    // 5. Process each task sequentially in work's tab\n    for _, task := range tasks {\n        processTaskInWork(task, work, worktreePath, zellijTab)\n    }\n\n    // 6. Create PR for entire work\n    createWorkPR(work, completedTasks)\n\n    // 7. Complete work or handle failures\n    database.CompleteWork(work.ID, prURL)\n}\n\nfunc processTaskInWork(task Task, work Work, worktreePath string, zellijTab string) {\n    // 1. Switch to work's tab\n    switchToZellijTab(zellijTab)\n\n    // 2. Run Claude in work's worktree with task context\n    // Tasks execute sequentially in the same tab, no separate panes\n    result := claude.Run(prompt, worktreePath, zellijSession, zellijTab)\n\n    // 3. Update task status based on result\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Claude Runner Updates\n\n#### Update: `internal/claude/runner.go`\n\nModify zellij management:\n- Works create tabs: `zellij action new-tab --name work-\u003cid\u003e`\n- Tasks run sequentially in the work's tab (no separate panes)\n- Each Claude session completes before the next task starts\n- Update monitoring to handle sequential task execution\n\n### 7. New Work Commands\n\n#### Create: `cmd/work.go`\n\nImplement work subcommands:\n```go\n// co work create - Create work with auto-generated ID\n// co work list - List all works with status\n// co work show [\u003cid\u003e] - Show work details (current dir or specified)\n// co work destroy \u003cid\u003e - Delete work subdirectory and database records\n```\n\nCommand structure using cobra:\n```go\nvar workCmd = \u0026cobra.Command{\n    Use:   \"work\",\n    Short: \"Manage work units\",\n}\n\nvar workCreateCmd = \u0026cobra.Command{\n    Use:   \"create\",\n    Short: \"Create a new work unit with auto-generated ID\",\n    Args:  cobra.NoArgs,\n    Run:   runWorkCreate,\n}\n\nvar workListCmd = \u0026cobra.Command{\n    Use:   \"list\",\n    Short: \"List all work units\",\n    Run:   runWorkList,\n}\n\nvar workShowCmd = \u0026cobra.Command{\n    Use:   \"show [\u003cid\u003e]\",\n    Short: \"Show work details (current directory or specified)\",\n    Args:  cobra.MaximumNArgs(1),\n    Run:   runWorkShow,\n}\n\nvar workDestroyCmd = \u0026cobra.Command{\n    Use:   \"destroy \u003cid\u003e\",\n    Short: \"Destroy a work unit and its worktree\",\n    Args:  cobra.ExactArgs(1),\n    Run:   runWorkDestroy,\n}\n```\n\n#### Work Creation Logic\n```go\nfunc runWorkCreate(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {\n    // 1. Generate work ID automatically\n    workID := generateWorkID() // e.g., \"work-1\", \"work-2\", etc.\n\n    // 2. Create work subdirectory\n    workDir := filepath.Join(projectDir, workID)\n    os.Mkdir(workDir, 0755)\n\n    // 3. Create git worktree inside work directory\n    worktreePath := filepath.Join(workDir, \"tree\")\n    branchName := fmt.Sprintf(\"work/%s\", workID)\n    git.CreateWorktree(worktreePath, branchName)\n\n    // 4. Create work record in database\n    database.CreateWork(workID, worktreePath, branchName)\n\n    // 5. Initialize mise in worktree if needed\n    if hasMiseConfig(worktreePath) {\n        mise.Initialize(worktreePath)\n    }\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"Created work: %s\\n\", workID)\n    fmt.Printf(\"Directory: %s\\n\", workDir)\n    fmt.Printf(\"Branch: %s\\n\", branchName)\n}\n\nfunc generateWorkID() string {\n    // Get next available work ID from database\n    lastID := database.GetLastWorkID()\n    nextNum := 1\n    if lastID != \"\" {\n        // Parse number from \"work-N\" format\n        parts := strings.Split(lastID, \"-\")\n        if len(parts) \u003e 1 {\n            num, _ := strconv.Atoi(parts[1])\n            nextNum = num + 1\n        }\n    }\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"work-%d\", nextNum)\n}\n```\n\n#### Context-Aware Commands\nCommands detect work context from current directory:\n```go\nfunc getCurrentWork() (string, error) {\n    // Check if we're in a work subdirectory\n    cwd, _ := os.Getwd()\n    if strings.Contains(cwd, \"/tree\") {\n        // Extract work ID from path: /project/work-id/tree/...\n        parts := strings.Split(cwd, \"/\")\n        for i, part := range parts {\n            if part == \"tree\" \u0026\u0026 i \u003e 0 {\n                return parts[i-1], nil\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"not in a work directory\")\n}\n\n// Use in commands:\nfunc runPlan(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {\n    workID := cmd.Flag(\"work\").Value.String()\n    if workID == \"\" {\n        workID, _ = getCurrentWork()\n    }\n    if workID == \"\" {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"no work context: use --work or run from work directory\")\n    }\n    // ... proceed with planning for this work\n}\n```\n\n### 8. Key Files to Modify\n\nCritical files requiring updates:\n- `/Users/matthew/co/internal/db/migrations/` - Add 002_add_works.sql\n- `/Users/matthew/co/internal/db/schema.sql` - Update reference schema\n- `/Users/matthew/co/sql/queries/` - Add works.sql, update tasks.sql\n- `/Users/matthew/co/cmd/plan.go` - Create works before tasks\n- `/Users/matthew/co/cmd/run.go` - Process works instead of tasks\n- `/Users/matthew/co/internal/claude/runner.go` - Tab/pane hierarchy\n- `/Users/matthew/co/internal/db/` - Add work.go, update task.go\n\n## Testing \u0026 Verification\n\n### Manual Testing Steps\n1. Build the updated co binary\n2. Create a test project: `co proj create test-work github.com/test/repo`\n3. Create work units and plan tasks:\n   ```bash\n   # Create first work\n   co work create      # Returns: Created work: work-1\n   cd work-1\n   co plan --auto-group\n\n   # Create second work\n   cd ..\n   co work create      # Returns: Created work: work-2\n   co plan --work work-2 bead-abc,bead-def\n   ```\n4. Run execution:\n   ```bash\n   co run --work work-1  # Run specific work\n   # OR\n   cd work-1 \u0026\u0026 co run   # Run from work directory\n   # OR\n   co run                # Run all pending works\n   ```\n5. Verify behavior:\n   - Work subdirectories created: `work-1/`, `work-2/`\n   - Git worktrees at: `work-1/tree/`, `work-2/tree/`\n   - Feature branches: `work/work-1`, `work/work-2`\n   - Zellij tabs created per work (no panes for tasks)\n   - Tasks run sequentially in work's tab\n   - One PR per work containing all task changes\n6. Check database state: `sqlite3 .co/tracking.db`\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM works;\n   SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE work_id = 'work-1';\n   SELECT * FROM work_tasks;\n   ```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n- One git worktree per work (not per task)\n- One feature branch per work\n- One zellij tab per work\n- Multiple panes (one per task) within work's tab\n- One PR per work containing all task changes\n- Tasks within a work share the same codebase state\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nSince backwards compatibility is not required:\n- Existing projects will need to be recreated\n- No data migration needed\n- Clean database schema without legacy fields","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-10T18:16:22.879826-05:00","created_by":"matthew","updated_at":"2026-01-10T21:18:23.444661-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-10T21:18:23.444661-05:00","close_reason":"All 9 dependent implementation tasks completed: database schema (ac-ymr), Go models (ac-s4d), SQLC queries (ac-61b), work commands (ac-dzl), planning phase (ac-129), execution phase (ac-pjw), Claude runner (ac-1gt), documentation (ac-ags), and testing (ac-rnx)","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ac-8wa","depends_on_id":"ac-ymr","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T18:19:07.411462-05:00","created_by":"matthew"},{"issue_id":"ac-8wa","depends_on_id":"ac-61b","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T18:19:07.531516-05:00","created_by":"matthew"},{"issue_id":"ac-8wa","depends_on_id":"ac-s4d","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T18:19:07.652075-05:00","created_by":"matthew"},{"issue_id":"ac-8wa","depends_on_id":"ac-129","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T18:19:07.766023-05:00","created_by":"matthew"},{"issue_id":"ac-8wa","depends_on_id":"ac-pjw","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T18:19:07.880426-05:00","created_by":"matthew"},{"issue_id":"ac-8wa","depends_on_id":"ac-1gt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T18:19:07.995124-05:00","created_by":"matthew"},{"issue_id":"ac-8wa","depends_on_id":"ac-dzl","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T18:19:08.09025-05:00","created_by":"matthew"},{"issue_id":"ac-8wa","depends_on_id":"ac-rnx","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T18:19:08.200347-05:00","created_by":"matthew"},{"issue_id":"ac-8wa","depends_on_id":"ac-ags","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T18:19:49.65032-05:00","created_by":"matthew"}]}

{"id":"ac-la1","title":"Project-based orchestrator with worktree isolation","description":"# Plan: Project-based Orchestrator with Worktree Isolation\n\n## Overview\n\nRestructure `co` to use a project-based model where:\n- Each project lives in its own directory with `.co/` for state\n- The target repo is symlinked (local) or cloned (GitHub) into `main/`\n- Each task gets an isolated git worktree\n- Zellij sessions are named per project/task for future parallelism\n- Beads issue tracking lives in the `main/` repo\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\n\u003cproject-dir\u003e/\n├── .co/\n│   ├── config.toml      # Project configuration\n│   └── tracking.db      # SQLite coordination database\n├── main/                # Symlink to local repo OR clone from GitHub\n│   └── .beads/          # Beads issue tracker (in repo)\n├── bead-123/            # Worktree for task bead-123\n├── bead-456/            # Worktree for task bead-456\n└── ...\n```\n\n## New Commands\n\n### `co proj create \u003cdir\u003e \u003crepo\u003e`\n\nCreates a new orchestrator project.\n\n**Arguments:**\n- `\u003cdir\u003e` - Path to create project directory\n- `\u003crepo\u003e` - Either local path (symlinked) or GitHub URL (cloned)\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Create `\u003cdir\u003e/` and `\u003cdir\u003e/.co/`\n2. Detect if `\u003crepo\u003e` is local path or GitHub URL\n3. If local: `ln -s \u003crepo\u003e \u003cdir\u003e/main`\n4. If GitHub: `git clone \u003crepo\u003e \u003cdir\u003e/main`\n5. Write `\u003cdir\u003e/.co/config.toml` with:\n   ```toml\n   [project]\n   name = \"\u003cdir-basename\u003e\"\n   created_at = \"2024-...\"\n\n   [repo]\n   type = \"local\" | \"github\"\n   source = \"\u003coriginal-path-or-url\u003e\"\n   path = \"main\"\n   ```\n6. Initialize `\u003cdir\u003e/.co/tracking.db`\n\n### `co proj destroy [--force]`\n\nTears down the current project.\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Find project root (walk up looking for `.co/`)\n2. List all worktrees and prompt for confirmation (unless `--force`)\n3. Remove all worktrees via `git worktree remove`\n4. Delete project directory\n\n### `co proj status`\n\nShows project status including active worktrees and task states.\n\n## Project Context Detection\n\n`co` commands find the project by walking up from cwd looking for `.co/`:\n- `/Users/matthew/proj/bead-xyz/foo/bar` → finds `/Users/matthew/proj/.co/`\n- Override with `--project=\u003cpath\u003e` flag on any command\n\n## Modified Workflow\n\n### `co run` Changes\n\n1. **Find project context** (cwd walk or `--project` flag)\n2. **Load config** from `.co/config.toml`\n3. **Query beads** from `main/` directory (where `.beads/` lives)\n4. **For each task:**\n   - Create worktree: `git -C main/ worktree add ../\u003ctask-id\u003e -b bead/\u003ctask-id\u003e`\n   - Launch Claude in Zellij session `co-\u003cproject-name\u003e`, pane named `\u003ctask-id\u003e`\n   - Claude works in `\u003cproject-dir\u003e/\u003ctask-id\u003e/`\n   - On success: `git worktree remove \u003ctask-id\u003e`\n   - On failure: Keep worktree for debugging\n\n### Zellij Session \u0026 Pane Model\n\n**Session**: One per project, named `co-\u003cproject-name\u003e`\n**Panes**: One per task, named after the task ID\n\nExample:\n- Session: `co-myapp`\n- Panes: `bead-123`, `bead-456`, etc.\n\nThis enables:\n- Multiple projects running simultaneously (separate sessions)\n- Future parallel task execution within a project (multiple panes)\n- Easy identification: `zellij -s co-myapp` shows all tasks for that project\n\n### Worktree Cleanup\n\n- **On success**: Remove worktree immediately\n- **On failure**: Keep worktree for debugging (user can inspect/fix)\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1. Add new `internal/project/` package\n\n```go\n// internal/project/project.go\ntype Project struct {\n    Root   string      // Project directory path\n    Config *Config     // Parsed config.toml\n    DB     *db.DB      // Tracking database\n}\n\ntype Config struct {\n    Project ProjectConfig\n    Repo    RepoConfig\n}\n\ntype ProjectConfig struct {\n    Name      string\n    CreatedAt time.Time\n}\n\ntype RepoConfig struct {\n    Type   string  // \"local\" or \"github\"\n    Source string  // Original path or URL\n    Path   string  // Always \"main\"\n}\n\nfunc Find(startDir string) (*Project, error)      // Walk up to find .co/\nfunc Create(dir, repoSource string) (*Project, error)\nfunc (p *Project) MainRepoPath() string           // Returns \u003croot\u003e/main\nfunc (p *Project) WorktreePath(taskID string) string\n```\n\n### 2. Add new `internal/worktree/` package\n\n```go\n// internal/worktree/worktree.go\nfunc Create(repoPath, worktreePath, branch string) error\nfunc Remove(repoPath, worktreePath string) error\nfunc List(repoPath string) ([]Worktree, error)\nfunc Exists(repoPath, worktreePath string) bool\n```\n\n### 3. Add `cmd/proj.go` with subcommands\n\n- `co proj create \u003cdir\u003e \u003crepo\u003e`\n- `co proj destroy [--force]`\n- `co proj status`\n\n### 4. Update `cmd/run.go`\n\n- Add `--project` flag\n- Use `project.Find()` to get context\n- Query beads from `project.MainRepoPath()`\n- Create worktrees for each task\n- Clean up worktrees on completion\n\n### 5. Update `internal/claude/runner.go`\n\n- Accept project name parameter\n- Use session name `co-\u003cproject\u003e` (one session per project)\n- Pane name is the task ID\n- Work directory is the worktree path\n\n### 6. Update database schema\n\nAdd project tracking:\n```sql\n-- Beads table gains project context\nALTER TABLE beads ADD COLUMN worktree_path TEXT;\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n| File | Changes |\n|------|---------|\n| `cmd/root.go` | Add `proj` command group, `--project` global flag |\n| `cmd/run.go` | Project context, worktree creation/cleanup |\n| `cmd/complete.go` | Find project from cwd |\n| `cmd/status.go` | Show worktree info |\n| `internal/claude/runner.go` | Project-aware session naming |\n| `internal/beads/client.go` | Accept repo path parameter |\n| `internal/db/db.go` | Path from project, schema update |\n\n## New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `cmd/proj.go` | Project management commands |\n| `internal/project/project.go` | Project discovery and config |\n| `internal/project/config.go` | TOML config parsing |\n| `internal/worktree/worktree.go` | Git worktree operations |\n\n## Verification\n\n1. **Create project from local repo:**\n   ```bash\n   co proj create ~/co-test ~/some-repo\n   ls ~/co-test/  # Should show .co/, main/\n   cat ~/co-test/.co/config.toml\n   ```\n\n2. **Create project from GitHub:**\n   ```bash\n   co proj create ~/co-github https://github.com/user/repo\n   ls ~/co-github/main/.git  # Should be a real clone\n   ```\n\n3. **Run from project dir:**\n   ```bash\n   cd ~/co-test\n   co run --dry-run  # Should find project, list beads from main/\n   ```\n\n4. **Run from subdirectory:**\n   ```bash\n   cd ~/co-test/main/src\n   co run --dry-run  # Should still find project root\n   ```\n\n5. **Worktree lifecycle:**\n   ```bash\n   co run  # Creates worktree, runs Claude, cleans up\n   ls ~/co-test/  # Worktree should be gone after completion\n   ```\n\n6. **Zellij session/pane:**\n   ```bash\n   zellij list-sessions  # Should show co-\u003cproject-name\u003e\n   zellij -s co-\u003cproject-name\u003e action list-panes  # Should show task panes\n   ```\n\n## Future Work (Out of Scope)\n\n- Dependency management between beads for parallel execution\n- Running multiple independent tasks concurrently in same Zellij session\n- `co proj list` to show all known projects\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-10T10:22:37.856945-05:00","created_by":"matthew","updated_at":"2026-01-10T10:45:14.697697-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-10T10:45:14.697697-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented all child tasks for project-based orchestrator with worktree isolation"}
